The program algorithm works in recursive descent that first will split every LHS into functions and this function will has their own grammar RHS side part. and will go using loop in every point, if this point match the terminal will go into it and will check if the grammar true or not,  if not it will return feedback what is expected if true it will continue. And so until it will reach the end of the tokens list.  The program looks like. For Recursive Descent Parser, we are going to write one program for every variable.

The program has feature that will rearrange automatically the input string into multiple stats lines by line.
This will help to make the input easy. To spread and become more readable.
It works by using just reserved word in one line to be easy to code, it arrange using state in every single line.

The Parse tree using Java Tree it helps to draw the tree of the input string.

Here the program shows multiple error feedback, that will return according to the problems of the code.
Using the rearrange ‘selected’ will arrange every state to line by line.
